Only Shows on Hover (CSS hover, not DHTML)
- To give the page a 'mystical' feeling, the words only appear if you are hovering
    the page, like magic ink. If you take your cursor off the screen, the prompts 
    and words will disappear.
- I wanted to create this feel because the game this is based on is a magical Massive
    Multiplayer Online (MMO).
- This is NOT the same as using visibility to show/hide sections, my sections are still
    dynamically created, this is just an overall page effect that I wanted to add.

Images
- All images are cropped and resized to fit page restrictions using Photoshop.

Background Image
- Used photoshop to make the image fit and have the transparent box
    spanning down the picture.

Displaying Results Image
- I created an array that updates each time the user picks
    an option, then after the user has picked all three, I created
    a function that would look at their choices and display a
    picture accordingly.

Usage of Local Storage
- Used the email submitted to 'send' the user an email of their results.
- 'send' because this is an offline project and it would not be possible.

Buttons and Dropdowns
- Added that hovering buttons/dropdown menus will change the cursor to a 
    pointer to show they are clickable.
